# Celestial Simulation
The goal of this project is create a Python framework for the simulation of 
star systems from simple a priori arguments.

For example, the Stefan-Boltzmann law allows us to estimate average surface 
temperature of a planet based only on the distance of the planet to its sun 
and the radius of that sun.

By nature of using simple equations to approximate very complex 
astrophysical interactions, this project is not intended to predict reality, 
but to help the user understand how small fluctuations can affect planetary 
bodies.

## Example Use
Check out the example.ipynb for a Jupyter Notebook demonstration of features
 currently available.
 
### Author's Note
Although this project is not intended for serious application, I do attempt to 
use sound theoretical calculations wherever possible. If you find an error, 
please let me know.

Values of constants and testing data are often approximated values. I have 
made an effort to credit the source where possible.
